# Known debt

What is known to fall short, why it stays for now, and when it is paid. Each item is short; the
[PLAN](PLAN.md) links here. Paid items are removed.

## Smithay and the HDR prototype

- The HDR metadata's primaries are sent red, green, blue; that order is not checked against
  CTA-861-G (M1.3's prototype sent them so and the monitor showed HDR; Stage 5 checks the order).
- Smithay `8fd9fe0` stops reading a CRTC's properties at the first of `ACTIVE` and
  `VRR_ENABLED` (`State::current_state`), so one of the two is not read back; it matters once
  Yuna uses VRR (Stage 4).
- Smithay's `DrmDevice`, dropped while active, commits back every property it read at opening,
  immutable ones and `DPMS` among them, which the kernel likely refuses: an exit may not give the
  previous state back. Check it at Stage 2, with a `tracing` subscriber.
- Smithay's connector property patch has debt to pay before main uses it
  ([patches](smithay-patches.md)).

## The layout model

- A dwindle tree deeper than its space gives its last windows empty slots: they are asked 1 × 1
  and not drawn ([ADR-0026](adr/0026-real-clients-in-the-layout.md)).
- Its timings were measured beside another build, and some 99th percentiles miss
  [ADR-0020](adr/0020-the-layout-models-shape.md)'s budgets ([measurements](measurements.md)):
  measured again on a quiet machine in M1.4.

## The headless compositor

- At a fractional scale, a client that draws at an integer buffer scale, rather than at its
  output's physical size through fractional scale and a viewport, is scaled when drawn: where its
  window geometry starts inside its surface, its right and bottom edges may blend up to one pixel
  of its margin. It stays while such a client's pixels are scaled anyway
  ([Scale](ARCHITECTURE.md#scale)).
- Virtual time is not kept from running ahead of real time while real clients are connected
  ([ADR-0023](adr/0023-frames-presentation-and-the-clock.md)); it matters when M1.5 steps the
  clock.
- No test draws a client's dmabuf: the stories check the `linux-dmabuf` global on llvmpipe and
  the protocol's errors only. llvmpipe imports a plain memfd as a dmabuf, so such a test needs no
  GPU. `--gpu`, and with it the dmabuf feedback, has not been run yet
  ([ADR-0022](adr/0022-the-headless-backend-in-yuna.md)).
- Every output draws one background frame when it is created, even with no client.
- The development shell's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (libglvnd, for EGL) applies to every program run in
  it.
